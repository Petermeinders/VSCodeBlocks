VSCode Blocks' is an extension for building code maps from snippets of code easily and quickly. Essentially providing a visual metadata design to your project. My goal is to keep this code-agnostic and efficiency-focused so that it will enhance a developers day to day work.

Secondary feature: An added feature that's highly experimental is for saving off blocks/snippets of your code into searchable/taggable blocks that can be seen and retrieved from a left sidebar. It uses JSON format to store and retrieve previously saved blocks and your store can be shared with others. I'm currently working on refining it and extending functionality further.


## Installation

Easy: Get the latest release, open VSCode, go to extensions tab, click 3 dots at top right -> install from VSIX file, locate downloaded file.

## Usage
You should now have a new icon on the bottom right of VSCode called "CodeBlocks" with a beaker. Click this and it will be opened in a new window on the right.

You can now select code, which will create a temporary block. Drag the block to make it permenant. 
Right click and color the block and the code will be colored respectively.

Double click a block to be taken to the code's location instantly.

Group similar blocks, store blocks temporarily in the "Pocket"...

And much more!

Right now this project is highly experimental and it's taking me time to fix all the bugs to get this to a stable state.

I'l be writing up much more documentation here later.
